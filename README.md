 ### Barceloway is a non-profit student project developed between 2020 and 2022 as part of my research work, which is a project that second-year high school students throughout Catalonia must submit to complete their baccalaureate studies. Since I was young, I've always been passionate about the world of programming, so I was certain that I wanted my project to be an app. It's worth mentioning that my programming knowledge was practically nonexistent, so I had to learn from scratch. After contemplating numerous ideas, I decided to create an application featuring my favorite spots in Barcelona.

#
#  🧩Why did I decide to design the app with Flutter?

### The app is designed with Flutter because of its versatility, enabling cross-platform development and providing a smooth user interface and experience. Additionally, during that time, I had a mobile device with an Android operating system. However, I knew that upon completing the project, I would switch to a phone with an iOS operating system. This motivated me to develop an application that would work on both operating systems. That's when I discovered the Dart language and Flutter SDK.

# 🕵️‍♀️ Things you should bear in mind before reading the project:
 ### 1 - It's a project created by (at that time) a 16/17-year-old with no programming background. The program could be considered to have a rather crude design, but the crucial aspect was to learn programming and create a project that I was passionate about, rather than opting for something simpler just to get a better grade.
 ### 2 -It's written in Catalan.
